Practical governance patterns for managing cloud costs at scale without slowing down delivery teams.
# FinOps Governance Framework

This repository outlines a practical governance approach for managing
cloud costs at scale while maintaining engineering velocity.

## Principles
- Clear cost ownership
- Automation over manual controls
- Guardrails instead of approvals

## Governance scope
- Tagging and ownership standards
- Budget alerts and thresholds
- Non-production cost controls
- Monthly cost review cadence

## Operating model
- Shared responsibility between finance, engineering, and platform teams
- Clear escalation paths for cost anomalies
- Continuous improvement through feedback loops
